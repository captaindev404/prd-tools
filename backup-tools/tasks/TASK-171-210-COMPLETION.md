# Task 171 & 210 Completion Report

## Overview
Successfully completed Task 171 (Mobile Drawer Behavior) and Task 210 (Panel Creation Wizard) for the Gentil Feedback platform.

## Task 171: Mobile Drawer Behavior

### Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Verified and documented the existing mobile drawer implementation that was already built into the shadcn Sidebar component.

### Implementation Details

The mobile drawer behavior is **already fully implemented** using the shadcn Sidebar component with Sheet integration:

#### 1. **Existing Infrastructure**
- **Sidebar Component**: `/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
  - Uses `useIsMobile()` hook to detect mobile viewport (<768px)
  - Automatically switches between fixed sidebar (desktop) and Sheet drawer (mobile)
  - Sheet overlay with click-to-close backdrop
  - Drawer slides in from left

- **Mobile Hook**: `/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx`
  - Breakpoint: 768px
  - Responsive media query listener
  - Returns boolean for mobile state

- **Header Integration**: `/src/components/layout/app-header.tsx`
  - SidebarTrigger visible on all viewports (line 227)
  - Works seamlessly for both mobile drawer and desktop sidebar

- **Layout**: `/src/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`
  - SidebarProvider wraps entire authenticated layout
  - Properly configured with AppSidebar and AppHeader

#### 2. **Mobile Behavior**
- **< 768px (Mobile)**:
  - Sidebar renders as Sheet drawer overlay
  - Hamburger menu trigger opens drawer
  - Drawer slides in from left
  - Backdrop overlay with click-to-close
  - No localStorage persistence for mobile state (always starts closed)

- **≥ 768px (Desktop)**:
  - Fixed sidebar with collapsible behavior
  - Trigger shows/hides sidebar
  - State persists via cookies

#### 3. **Accessibility Features**
- Screen reader friendly ("Toggle Sidebar" label)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in drawer
- ARIA attributes for Sheet component

### Files Verified
- `/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` - Main sidebar with mobile support
- `/src/components/ui/sheet.tsx` - Sheet component for mobile drawer
- `/src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx` - Mobile detection hook
- `/src/components/layout/app-header.tsx` - Header with trigger
- `/src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar navigation
- `/src/app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx` - Layout provider

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Mobile drawer opens on hamburger click (<768px)
- [x] Drawer slides in from left
- [x] Backdrop overlay present
- [x] Click outside closes drawer
- [x] Desktop sidebar works normally (≥768px)
- [x] Navigation hierarchy same on mobile/desktop
- [x] Keyboard navigation works
- [x] Screen reader accessible

### Notes
- No code changes required - feature already fully implemented
- Implementation follows shadcn best practices
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Task 210: Panel Creation Wizard

### Status: COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Created a multi-step wizard component for creating research panels with step-by-step navigation, validation, and summary.
