---

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used
All required shadcn/ui components were already installed:
- ✅ Dialog
- ✅ Tabs
- ✅ Badge
- ✅ Skeleton
- ✅ ScrollArea
- ✅ Checkbox
- ✅ Select
- ✅ Card
- ✅ Button
- ✅ Form

### Form Validation
Task 201 implements dynamic Zod schema generation based on question configuration:
```typescript
const questions = JSON.parse(data.questions || '[]');
const schema: any = {};

questions.forEach((q: any) => {
  if (q.required) {
    schema[q.id] = z.any().refine(val => val !== undefined && val !== '' && val !== null, {
      message: 'This question is required',
    });
  } else {
    schema[q.id] = z.any().optional();
  }
});

setFormSchema(z.object(schema));
```

### API Response Handling
InviteMembersDialog handles complex API responses with success/failure tracking:
```typescript
{
  added: number,
  skipped: [
    { userId: string, reason: string },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Build Verification

✅ **Build Status**: Successful
```bash
npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Generating static pages (44/44)
```

**Warnings**: Only ESLint exhaustive-deps warnings (consistent with existing codebase)
