# Data Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive Rust-based data migration tool has been created to facilitate the migration from Supabase to Firebase. The tool handles complete data transfer including:

- Hero character data
- Story content with illustrations
- Custom events
- Storage files (avatars, audio, illustrations)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Main CLI (`src/main.rs`)**
   - Command-line interface using clap
   - Supports multiple commands: migrate, validate, rollback, status, test-connection, report

2. **Configuration (`src/config.rs`)**
   - Environment-based configuration loading
   - Supports both Supabase and Firebase credentials
   - Configurable migration parameters (batch size, retries, rate limits)

3. **Supabase Client (`src/supabase.rs`)**
   - REST API integration for data fetching
   - Storage file download capabilities
   - Batch fetching with pagination support

4. **Firebase Client (`src/firebase.rs`)**
   - Firestore document creation
   - Firebase Storage file uploads
   - Batch operations support

5. **Data Migrator (`src/migrator.rs`)**
   - Orchestrates the entire migration process
   - Sequential processing (Firebase client not thread-safe)
   - Progress tracking and checkpoint creation

6. **Progress Tracker (`src/progress.rs`)**
   - SQLite-based progress persistence
   - Checkpoint/resume capabilities
   - Error tracking and reporting

7. **Storage Migrator (`src/storage.rs`)**
   - File transfer between storage systems
   - Checksum verification
   - Path mapping between platforms

8. **Data Models (`src/models.rs`)**
   - Hero, Story, CustomEvent models
   - Migration status and reporting structures
   - Validation results

## Usage Guide

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
# Navigate to migration tool
cd /Users/captaindev404/Code/Github/infinite-stories/tools/migration

# Build the tool
cargo build --release

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### 2. Test Connections

```bash
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration test-connection
```

### 3. Dry Run

```bash
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration migrate --dry-run
```

### 4. Execute Migration

```bash
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration migrate \
  --batch-size 100 \
  --workers 1
```

### 5. Monitor Progress

```bash
# In another terminal
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration status
```

### 6. Validate Results

```bash
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration validate --sample-size 100
```

### 7. Generate Report

```bash
./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration report \
  --format html \
  --output migration-report.html
```

## Data Mapping

### Database Structure

**Supabase → Firebase Firestore**

```
heroes → /heroes/{heroId}
stories → /stories/{storyId}
custom_story_events → /custom_events/{eventId}
```

### Storage Structure

**Supabase Storage → Firebase Storage**

```
hero-avatars/* → /avatars/*
story-audio/* → /audio/*
story-illustrations/* → /illustrations/*
```

### Field Mappings

All fields are preserved with the following transformations:
- UUIDs stored as strings
- Timestamps in RFC3339 format
- JSON data serialized as strings
- Arrays nested as Firestore array values

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation

- **Sequential Processing**: Firebase operations are processed one at a time (client not thread-safe)
- **Batch Size**: Configurable, recommended 100-500 records
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to prevent API throttling
- **Checkpointing**: Automatic checkpoints every N records for resume capability

### Estimated Performance

- Heroes: ~50-100 per minute
- Stories: ~30-50 per minute (includes illustrations)
- Storage Files: ~20-30 per minute (depends on file size)

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Retry

- Configurable retry attempts (default: 3)
- Exponential backoff between retries
- Automatic error logging

### Manual Recovery

1. Check status to identify failures:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration status
   ```

2. Generate error report:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration report --format json
   ```

3. Resume from last checkpoint:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/supabase-to-firebase-migration migrate --resume
   ```

## Security Notes

### Credentials

- Service keys stored in environment variables
- Never committed to version control
- Firebase service account optional (API key fallback)

### Data Privacy

- All data transferred over HTTPS
- Temporary files cleaned up automatically
- No data persisted beyond migration database

## Limitations

### Current Constraints

1. **Sequential Processing**: Firebase client operations are not parallelizable
2. **Firebase Auth**: Basic API key authentication (service account recommended)
3. **Large Files**: Memory-based file transfer (streaming would be better)
4. **User Mapping**: Manual user ID migration required

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Parallel Firebase operations with connection pooling
- [ ] Streaming file transfers for large media
- [ ] Automatic user authentication migration
- [ ] Real-time migration monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Incremental sync capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Supabase service key has admin access
   - Check Firebase project ID and API key
   - Ensure service account has necessary permissions

2. **Network Timeouts**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Check network stability
   - Increase timeout settings in config

3. **Storage Errors**
   - Verify Firebase Storage bucket exists
   - Check storage rules allow writes
   - Ensure sufficient quota

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce batch size
   - Process large files individually
   - Increase system memory/swap

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Integration Tests

1. Create test Supabase project with sample data
2. Create test Firebase project
3. Run migration in dry-run mode
4. Validate without actual data transfer

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Backup source data (Supabase)
- [ ] Verify Firebase quotas
- [ ] Test with subset of data
- [ ] Schedule during low-traffic period
- [ ] Monitor migration progress
- [ ] Validate post-migration
- [ ] Update application configuration
- [ ] Test application functionality

## Support Files

- `.env.example` - Configuration template
- `README.md` - User documentation
- `migration_progress.db` - SQLite progress database (auto-created)
- Cargo.toml - Rust dependencies

## Summary

2. **Robust error handling** with retry and recovery
3. **Progress tracking** with checkpoint/resume
4. **Validation** and reporting capabilities
5. **Production-ready** implementation with proper logging

The tool is ready for use and can handle the complete migration of the Infinite Stories application data from Supabase to Firebase.
