## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- Client Components for interactivity (dialogs, filters)
- API Routes with proper error handling
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces

### UI/UX
- Shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Accessible with keyboard navigation
- Responsive design (mobile to desktop)
- Loading states and error handling
- Confirmation dialogs for critical actions

### Database Operations
- Efficient Prisma queries with includes
- Pagination support
- JSON field parsing (village history, consents)
- Activity aggregation from multiple tables

## Dependencies Added
- date-fns (already in package.json)
- shadcn/ui components:
  - dropdown-menu (added)
  - avatar (added)
  - All other required components already present

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Authentication**
   - Access /admin as non-admin → should redirect to /unauthorized
   - Access /admin as ADMIN → should show dashboard

2. **User Management**
   - List users with filters (role, village, search)
   - Edit user role → verify event logged
   - Edit user village → verify history updated
   - View user detail → verify all tabs work
   - Try to edit own role → should prevent

3. **Village Management**
   - Create village → verify appears in list
   - Create duplicate village ID → should error
   - View village statistics

4. **UI/UX**
   - Test responsive design on mobile
   - Verify pagination works
   - Test search functionality
   - Verify all dialogs open/close properly

### API Testing
```bash
# List users (requires ADMIN session)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users

# Get user details
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users/{userId}

# Update user role
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "usr_xxx", "role": "PM"}'

# List villages
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/villages

# Create village
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/villages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "vlg-002", "name": "Phuket"}'
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ Only ADMIN role can access /admin routes
✅ User management table displays all users
✅ Admins can edit user roles
✅ Admins can change user village assignments
✅ User activity log shows comprehensive history
✅ Village management works (create, edit, list)
✅ Dashboard shows system overview
✅ UI is responsive and uses Shadcn components
✅ Proper error handling and loading states
✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
✅ Role changes are logged in events

## Known Limitations

1. **Soft Delete Implementation**: Uses email modification for deactivation (SQLite limitation). In production, add `active` or `deactivatedAt` field.

2. **Server Component API Calls**: User detail page makes fetch calls to own API (workaround for server component data fetching). Could be optimized with direct Prisma calls.

3. **Pagination**: Basic implementation, could be enhanced with sorting options.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to update multiple users at once
2. **Advanced Filtering**: More complex filter combinations
3. **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export for user data
4. **Audit Trail View**: Dedicated page for viewing all admin actions
5. **Email Notifications**: Notify users of role/village changes
6. **Village Settings**: Additional village-specific configuration options
