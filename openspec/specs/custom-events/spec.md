## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change migrate-custom-events-api. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Custom Events CRUD API

The backend SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for managing custom story events with user ownership.

#### Scenario: User lists their custom events

**Given** an authenticated user with custom events in the database
**When** the user GETs `/api/v1/custom-events`
**Then** the API returns all events owned by that user
**And** the response includes pagination metadata
**And** events are ordered by `createdAt` descending

#### Scenario: User lists custom events with pagination

**Given** an authenticated user with 25 custom events
**When** the user GETs `/api/v1/custom-events?limit=10&offset=10`
**Then** the API returns events 11-20
**And** the response includes `hasMore: true`

#### Scenario: User creates a custom event

**Given** an authenticated user
**When** the user POSTs to `/api/v1/custom-events` with valid event data
**Then** a new event is created in the database with `userId` set to the authenticated user
**And** the response includes the created event with status 201
**And** the event has `usageCount: 0` and `isFavorite: false`

#### Scenario: User creates event with invalid data

**Given** an authenticated user
**When** the user POSTs to `/api/v1/custom-events` without required fields (title, promptSeed)
**Then** the API returns 400 Bad Request
**And** the error message lists missing required fields

#### Scenario: User retrieves a single custom event

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**When** the user GETs `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123`
**Then** the API returns the event details with status 200

#### Scenario: User retrieves event they don't own

**Given** an authenticated user
**And** an event with id "xyz789" owned by a different user
**When** the user GETs `/api/v1/custom-events/xyz789`
**Then** the API returns 404 Not Found
**And** no event data is leaked

#### Scenario: User updates a custom event

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**When** the user PATCHes `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123` with `{ "title": "New Title" }`
**Then** the event title is updated
**And** the `updatedAt` timestamp is refreshed
**And** the response includes the updated event

#### Scenario: User marks event as favorite

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**When** the user PATCHes `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123` with `{ "isFavorite": true }`
**Then** the event `isFavorite` is set to true
**And** the response includes the updated event

#### Scenario: User deletes a custom event

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**When** the user DELETEs `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123`
**Then** the event is removed from the database
**And** the response is 204 No Content

#### Scenario: User deletes event they don't own

**Given** an authenticated user
**And** an event with id "xyz789" owned by a different user
**When** the user DELETEs `/api/v1/custom-events/xyz789`
**Then** the API returns 404 Not Found
**And** the event is not deleted

### Requirement: Custom Event AI Enhancement

The backend SHALL provide an endpoint to enhance custom event prompts using AI.

#### Scenario: User enhances a custom event

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**And** the event has `aiEnhanced: false`
**When** the user POSTs to `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123/enhance`
**Then** the backend calls GPT-4o-mini to enhance the prompt seed
**And** relevant keywords are generated
**And** the event `aiEnhanced` is set to true
**And** the `aiEnhancementMetadata` stores enhancement details
**And** the response includes the enhanced event

#### Scenario: User enhances already-enhanced event

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**And** the event has `aiEnhanced: true`
**When** the user POSTs to `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123/enhance`
**Then** the backend re-enhances the prompt
**And** the `aiEnhancementMetadata` is updated
**And** the response includes the re-enhanced event

#### Scenario: AI enhancement fails

**Given** an authenticated user who owns event with id "abc123"
**When** the user POSTs to `/api/v1/custom-events/abc123/enhance`
**And** the OpenAI API call fails
**Then** the API returns 500 Internal Server Error
**And** the original event data is not modified
**And** the error is logged for debugging

### Requirement: Usage Tracking

The backend SHALL track custom event usage when stories are created.

#### Scenario: Story created with custom event increments usage

**Given** an authenticated user creates a story with `customEventId: "abc123"`
**When** the story is successfully created
**Then** the custom event's `usageCount` is incremented by 1
**And** the `lastUsedAt` is updated to the current timestamp

### Requirement: iOS API Integration

The iOS app SHALL use the backend API for all custom event operations.

#### Scenario: iOS app fetches custom events on view appear

**Given** the user opens the custom events management view
**When** the view appears
**Then** the repository calls `GET /api/v1/custom-events`
**And** a loading indicator is shown during the request
**And** the events are displayed when loaded

#### Scenario: iOS app handles network error

**Given** the user opens the custom events management view
**When** the API request fails due to network error
**Then** an error view is displayed
**And** the error view includes a retry button
**And** tapping retry re-attempts the request

#### Scenario: iOS app creates custom event

**Given** the user fills out the custom event creation form
**When** the user taps save
**Then** the repository calls `POST /api/v1/custom-events`
**And** a loading indicator is shown
**And** on success, the user is navigated back to the events list
**And** the new event appears in the list

#### Scenario: iOS app blocks operations when offline

**Given** the device has no network connection
**When** the user attempts to create, edit, or delete a custom event
**Then** the operation is blocked
**And** an offline message is displayed
