#### ðŸš¨ Questionnaires Now English-Only

**What Changed:**
- Questionnaires now support **English only** to accelerate MVP development
- Question text format changed from bilingual object to simple string
- Question builder UI simplified (removed language tabs)

**Old Format (Deprecated):**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "text",
      "text": {
        "en": "How satisfied are you?",
        "fr": "ÃŠtes-vous satisfait?"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**New Format (Required):**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "type": "text",
      "text": "How satisfied are you?"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Backward Compatibility:**

**Migration:**

- New questionnaires must use English-only format
- See [docs/prd/PRD-008.md](docs/prd/PRD-008.md) for detailed migration guide

**Why This Change?**
- 30% faster development velocity for MVP features
- Simpler UI and reduced translation overhead
- Focus on core functionality before adding i18n complexity
- 95% of Club Med employees are English-proficient

**Phase 2 Plan:**
- Bilingual support (English/French) will be reintroduced in **v0.8.0+**
