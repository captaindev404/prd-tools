Automated security testing script that validates:
- Authentication enforcement
- Rate limiting
- File size/type/count limits
- Filename security (directory traversal, XSS)
- MIME type spoofing
- Magic byte validation
- Public access controls

**Usage**:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/security/file-upload-pentest.sh
./scripts/security/file-upload-pentest.sh http://localhost:3000 "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Output**: Color-coded test results with vulnerability count

## Critical Issues

### C-STOR-001: Files in Public Directory

**Status**: üî¥ BLOCKING PRODUCTION

**Issue**: Uploaded files stored in `/public/uploads/` are directly accessible without authentication.

- [ ] Magic byte validation working
- [ ] Run penetration test suite
- [ ] Security team sign-off

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Full penetration test
./scripts/security/file-upload-pentest.sh http://localhost:3000 "Bearer TOKEN"

# Unit tests
npm test -- file-upload.test.ts
