## What Was Built

### Test File Created
- **Location**: `__tests__/api/panels.test.ts`

- ✅ 403 Forbidden (not RESEARCHER/PM/ADMIN)
- ✅ 404 Not Found
- ✅ Sample limited to 10 users
- ✅ Invalid eligibility rules JSON handling
- ✅ Note when count reaches limit of 200

## Technical Implementation

### Test Structure
```typescript
/**
 * @jest-environment node
 */
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { Role } from '@prisma/client'
// Import route handlers directly
```

### Mocking Strategy
- **Prisma Client**: Mocked all database operations
- **Auth Helpers**: Mocked getCurrentUser, canManagePanelMembers
- **Panel Eligibility**: Mocked validation and filtering functions
- **Notifications**: Mocked sendPanelInviteNotification

### Test Patterns Used
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Success, error, validation, edge cases
3. **Isolation**: Each test is independent with beforeEach cleanup
4. **Mock Data**: Realistic user, panel, and membership objects
5. **Error Scenarios**: 401, 403, 404, 400 responses tested

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Test PATCH /api/panels/[id] success and errors
- [x] Test DELETE /api/panels/[id] soft delete
- [x] Test POST /api/panels/[id]/members bulk invite
- [x] Test DELETE /api/panels/[id]/members/[userId]
- [x] Test GET /api/panels/[id]/eligibility-preview
- [x] Test permission checks (401, 403)
- [x] Test ownership checks for edit/delete
- [x] Test eligibility validation
- [x] All tests passing ✅

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `__tests__/api/panels.test.ts` - 36 comprehensive test cases

### Updated Files (Bug Fixes)
- `__tests__/api/feedback.test.ts` - Added `@jest-environment node` comment
- `__tests__/api/vote.test.ts` - Added `@jest-environment node` comment

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run panel tests only
npm test -- __tests__/api/panels.test.ts

# Run all API tests
npm test -- __tests__/api/

# Run with coverage
npm test -- __tests__/api/panels.test.ts --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- __tests__/api/panels.test.ts --watch
```

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. Using existing test infrastructure:
- `jest` - Test runner
- `@types/jest` - TypeScript types for Jest
- NextRequest/NextResponse from Next.js for API route testing

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Test Maintenance**: When API routes are updated, corresponding tests should be updated
2. **Coverage**: Tests cover happy path, error cases, validation, and edge cases
3. **Isolation**: All tests use mocks to avoid database dependencies
4. **Performance**: Tests run in ~200ms, suitable for CI/CD pipelines
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new test cases following existing patterns
