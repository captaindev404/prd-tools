## What Was Found (Already Implemented)

### 1. QuestionBuilder Component
**Location**: `/Users/captaindev404/Code/club-med/gentil-feedback/src/components/questionnaires/question-builder.tsx`

- Type-specific configuration UI
- Responsive layout (mobile/tablet/desktop)

**Accessibility Features**:
- Proper ARIA labels and roles

- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Focus management

### 2. Integration in QuestionnaireCreateForm
**Location**: `/Users/captaindev404/Code/club-med/gentil-feedback/src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-create-form.tsx`

**State Management** (Line 45):
```typescript
const [questions, setQuestions] = useState<Question[]>([]);
```

**Import** (Line 15):
```typescript
import { QuestionBuilder, Question } from './question-builder';
```

**Tab Integration** (Lines 363-376):
```typescript
<TabsContent value="questions" className="space-y-4">
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Build Your Questions</CardTitle>
      <CardDescription>
        Add and configure questions for your questionnaire.
      </CardDescription>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      <QuestionBuilder questions={questions} onChange={setQuestions} />
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</TabsContent>
```

**State Updates**:
- Questions array updates via `setQuestions` callback
- Changes propagate correctly through React state
- Form submission includes all question data

### 3. Validation Implementation
**Location**: Lines 78-94 of questionnaire-create-form.tsx

**Validation Rules**:
```typescript
// At least 1 question required
if (questions.length === 0) {
  return 'At least one question is required';
}

// All questions must have text
for (let i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
  const q = questions[i];
  if (!q?.text.trim()) {
    return `Question ${i + 1} must have text`;
  }

  // MCQ must have at least 2 options
  if ((q.type === 'mcq_single' || q.type === 'mcq_multiple') &&
      (!q.config?.options || q.config.options.length < 2)) {
    return `Question ${i + 1} (Multiple Choice) must have at least 2 options`;
  }
}
```

**Error Handling**:
- Clear error messages with question numbers
- Error displayed in Alert component
- Focus management for accessibility
- Screen reader announcements

### 4. Form Submission
**Location**: Lines 138-161 of questionnaire-create-form.tsx

**Data Transformation**:
```typescript
const transformedQuestions = questions.map((q, index) => ({
  id: q.id,
  type: q.type,
  text: q.text,
  required: q.required,
  order: index,
  config: q.config,
}));

const createData = {
  title: title.trim(),
  questions: transformedQuestions,
  targeting: { ... },
  anonymous,
  responseLimit: ...,
  startAt: ...,
  endAt: ...,
  maxResponses: ...,
};
```

**API Integration**:
- POST to `/api/questionnaires`
- Proper error handling
- Success redirection
- Toast notifications
