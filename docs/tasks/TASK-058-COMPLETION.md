# Task #58 Completion Report: Recently Used Panels Quick-Select

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Implementation Approach**: localStorage (client-side)

## Overview

Implemented a "Recently Used Panels" feature that tracks the last 5 panels used by researchers when creating questionnaires, providing one-click quick access to frequently used panels.

## What Was Built

### 1. Storage Layer (`/src/lib/recent-panels-storage.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Manages localStorage persistence for recently used research panels
- **Key Features**:
  - Stores last 5 panels with timestamps
  - Validates data structure on read
  - Handles localStorage errors gracefully
  - Server-side rendering safe (checks for `window` object)
  - Deduplicates entries automatically

**API**:
```typescript
getRecentPanels(): string[]           // Get panel IDs, most recent first
addRecentPanel(panelId: string): void // Add single panel
addRecentPanels(panelIds: string[]): void // Add multiple panels
clearRecentPanels(): void            // Clear all
isRecentPanel(panelId: string): boolean // Check if in list
```

### 2. React Hook (`/src/hooks/useRecentPanels.ts`)

- **Purpose**: React hook for managing recently used panels with full panel data
- **Key Features**:
  - Loads from localStorage on mount
  - Syncs across browser tabs via `storage` event listener
  - Provides full Panel objects (not just IDs)
  - Optimistic UI updates
  - Memoized panel filtering for performance

**Hook Interface**:
```typescript
interface UseRecentPanelsReturn {
  recentPanelIds: string[];           // Array of panel IDs
  recentPanels: Panel[];              // Full panel objects
  addRecentPanel: (panelId: string) => void;
  addRecentPanels: (panelIds: string[]) => void;
  clearRecentPanels: () => void;
  isRecentPanel: (panelId: string) => boolean;
  refreshRecentPanels: () => void;
}
```

### 3. UI Integration (`/src/components/research/TargetingTab.tsx`)

**Added Recently Used Section**:
- Displayed above the main panel selector when `targetingType === 'specific_panels'`
- Shows up to 5 recently used panels as clickable buttons
- Visual indicator (Clock icon) for "recently used" status
- Badge showing member count for each panel
- Selected panels highlighted with primary variant
- "Clear" button to reset recent panels list
- Tooltips and accessibility labels

**UI Structure**:
```tsx
{recentPanels.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mb-4 space-y-2 pb-4 border-b">
    <Label>Recently Used</Label>
    <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
      {recentPanels.map(panel => (
        <Button variant={isSelected ? 'default' : 'outline'}>
          <Clock className="mr-1.5 h-3 w-3" />
          {panel.name}
          <Badge>{panel._count.memberships}</Badge>
        </Button>
      ))}
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### 4. Tracking Logic (`/src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-create-form.tsx`)

**Added Import**:
```typescript
import { addRecentPanels } from '@/lib/recent-panels-storage';
```

**Added Tracking on Publish**:
```typescript
// After successful publish, before redirect
if (targetingType === 'specific_panels' && selectedPanels.length > 0) {
  addRecentPanels(selectedPanels);
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Why localStorage over Database?

**Chosen Approach: localStorage**

Reasons:
1. **Performance**: Instant access, no API calls
2. **Privacy**: Per-device/browser, not tied to user account
3. **Simplicity**: No database schema changes needed
4. **User-centric**: Different researchers may use shared accounts but want personal quick-access
5. **Zero backend load**: No additional database queries

Trade-offs:
- Not synced across devices (acceptable for this use case)
- Cleared if user clears browser data (acceptable)
- Limited to 5MB total localStorage (our 5 panel IDs are negligible)

### Storage Format

```typescript
[
  { panelId: "pan_01ABC...", timestamp: 1697654400000 },
  { panelId: "pan_02DEF...", timestamp: 1697568000000 },
  ...
]
```

- Stores timestamps to enable future features (e.g., expiration, "last used X days ago")
- Always sorted by timestamp descending (most recent first)

### UI Placement

Placed at the **top** of the panel selector section because:
1. Saves vertical scrolling for power users
2. "Recently used" is a common pattern (see: file pickers, IDEs)
3. Doesn't interfere with search/browse workflows
4. Visually separated with border-bottom

## User Experience Flow

### First-Time User
1. Create questionnaire → Select "Specific Panels" → Choose from list
2. Publish → Panels saved to recent list
3. **Next time**: Recent panels appear at top for one-click selection

### Power User (Repeated Use)
1. Create questionnaire → Select "Specific Panels"
2. **Click recently used panel button** → Selected instantly
3. Publish → Recent panels updated

### Managing Recent Panels
- **Clear button**: Removes all recent panels (e.g., for shared computers)
- **Auto-deduplication**: Selecting same panel again just updates timestamp
- **Limit enforcement**: Only last 5 panels kept

## Accessibility

- All buttons have `aria-label` for screen readers
- Selected/deselected state communicated via `aria-pressed`
- Icons have `aria-hidden="true"`
- Clear button has descriptive label
- Keyboard navigable (standard button tab order)

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses standard `localStorage` API (supported in all modern browsers)
- Graceful degradation: If localStorage fails, feature silently disabled
- Handles `window` undefined (SSR-safe)

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization**: `recentPanels` computed via `useMemo` to avoid re-filtering on every render
2. **Event Listener**: Storage event only fires for other tabs/windows (not same-tab updates)
3. **Minimal Storage**: Storing only panel IDs (~20 chars × 5 = ~100 bytes)
4. **No Network**: All operations are local (zero latency)

## Testing Considerations

**Manual Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Publish questionnaire with panels → Recent panels appear next time
- [ ] Click recently used panel → Panel selected
- [ ] Click again → Panel deselected
- [ ] Publish with 3 panels → All 3 appear in recent list
- [ ] Publish 6 different times → Only last 5 panels kept
- [ ] Click "Clear" → Recent list disappears
- [ ] Open two tabs → Changes sync across tabs
- [ ] Works in incognito mode (cleared on browser close)

**Edge Cases Covered**:
- Panel deleted from system but in recent list → Filtered out by hook
- localStorage disabled/unavailable → No errors, feature disabled
- Corrupted localStorage data → Validated and reset
- SSR/hydration → `typeof window` checks prevent errors

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Show "Last Used" Timestamp**: Display "Used 2 days ago"
2. **Panel Usage Analytics**: Track which panels are most popular
3. **Server-side Sync**: Store in user preferences table for cross-device sync
4. **Search Integration**: Show recent panels in autocomplete results
5. **Expiration**: Remove panels not used in 30 days

## Dependencies

**No new dependencies added** - uses existing libraries:
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`)
- Shadcn UI components (Button, Badge, Label)
- Lucide React icons (Clock, X)

## Migration Notes

**No database migration needed** - this is a pure frontend feature.

## Acceptance Criteria (from PRD)

- ✅ Tracks last 5 panels used by current user
- ✅ Shows "Recently Used" section above panel selector
- ✅ One-click selection via button click
- ✅ Updates when questionnaire is published
- ✅ Persists across sessions (via localStorage)
- ✅ Saves time for power users (no scrolling/searching)

## Usage Example

### Scenario: Researcher Creating Weekly Survey

**Week 1** (First time):
```
1. Navigate to /research/questionnaires/new
2. Select "Specific Panels"
3. Scroll through list → Select "Beta Testers" panel
4. Publish questionnaire
```

**Week 2** (Power user workflow):
```
1. Navigate to /research/questionnaires/new
2. Select "Specific Panels"
3. SEE: [Clock] Beta Testers (45) button at top ✨
4. Click button → Panel selected
5. Publish (2 clicks saved, zero scrolling!)
```

## Summary

This feature improves the workflow for researchers who frequently target the same panels, reducing clicks and cognitive load. The localStorage approach provides instant access without backend complexity, making it ideal for this use case. The implementation follows React best practices with proper hooks, memoization, and error handling.
