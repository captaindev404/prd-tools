---

## Implementation Overview

### 1. API Endpoints (4 files)

#### `/src/app/api/roadmap/timeline/route.ts`
- **GET endpoint** for timeline/Gantt data retrieval
- Auto-calculates start dates based on target dates and stage
- Groups items by stage (now, next, later, under_consideration)
- Respects visibility permissions (public vs internal)
- Optional filters: stage, includeCompleted
- Rate limited and authenticated

#### `/src/app/api/roadmap/milestones/route.ts`
- **GET endpoint** for milestone tracking
- Calculates milestone status: on-track, at-risk, delayed, completed
- Status logic:
  - `completed`: 100% progress
  - `delayed`: past target date and not completed
  - `at-risk`: < 30 days remaining and < 75% progress
  - `on-track`: all other cases
- Returns summary statistics (total, completed, onTrack, atRisk, delayed)
- Aggregates feature and feedback counts

#### `/src/app/api/roadmap/publish/route.ts`
- **POST endpoint** for publishing roadmap updates to stakeholders
- Multi-channel support: in-app notifications, email
- Audience filtering: villages, roles, panels, or all users
- Respects user notification preferences (roadmapUpdates setting)
- Integrates with SendGrid for email delivery
- Logs events and tracks send metrics
- Custom message support with auto-generated fallback

#### `/src/app/api/roadmap/changelog/route.ts`
- **GET endpoint**: Returns changelog entries (JSON)
- **POST endpoint**: Generates formatted changelog documents
- Supports multiple formats: HTML, Markdown, JSON
- Auto-determines change type: new (< 7 days old), updated, completed (100% progress)
- Includes features, feedbacks, and Jira tickets in entries
- Groups by change type with summary statistics
- Date range filtering with `since` parameter

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - API routes handle data fetching and business logic
   - Components focus on presentation and user interaction
   - Integration clients centralize external API calls

2. **Data Flow**:
   - Server components fetch initial data where possible
   - Client components handle interactivity (tabs, selection, forms)
   - API routes provide JSON responses for dynamic updates

3. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Jira and Figma clients are opt-in (gracefully handle missing config)
   - Environment variables control feature availability
   - Validation before external API calls

4. **User Experience**:
   - Loading states for all async operations
   - Error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Toast notifications for action feedback
   - Empty states with helpful messaging

### Key Features

#### Timeline Visualization
- Uses Recharts BarChart with layout="vertical" for Gantt-style view
- Auto-calculates start dates: `targetDate - durationDays`
- Duration varies by stage (now=30d, next=60d, later=90d)
- Color-coded cells using stage colors
- Custom tooltips with rich metadata

#### Milestone Status Algorithm
```typescript
if (progress === 100) return 'completed';
if (!targetDate) return 'on-track';

const daysUntilTarget = (targetDate - now) / (1000*60*60*24);

if (daysUntilTarget < 0) return 'delayed';
if (daysUntilTarget < 30 && progress < 75) return 'at-risk';
return 'on-track';
```

#### Changelog Generation
- **Change Type Detection**:
  - `completed`: progress === 100
  - `new`: created within last 7 days
  - `updated`: all others
- Multiple output formats with different styling
- HTML output includes inline CSS for email-safe rendering
- Markdown output follows standard format

#### Notification Publishing
- Audience building with Prisma query
- Respects `NotificationPreferences.roadmapUpdates`
- Batch notification creation for performance
- Email sending with retry logic (continues on individual failures)
- Event logging for audit trail
