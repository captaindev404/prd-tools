**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Task ID**: TASK-042
**Priority**: High

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive preview mode for questionnaire creation, allowing users to see exactly how their questionnaire will appear to respondents before publishing. The implementation includes full bilingual support (EN/FR) with language toggling and interactive question rendering.

## What Was Built

### 1. QuestionnairePreviewModal Component
**File**: `/src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-preview-modal.tsx`

A fully-featured modal component that displays questionnaires as respondents will see them:

#### Features Implemented:
- **Modal Dialog** using Shadcn UI Dialog component
- **Language Toggle** (EN/FR) with Tabs component

- **Read-only Mode** - Clear indicators that responses won't be saved
- **Disabled Submit Button** - Shows "Submit (Preview Mode)" as disabled
- **Question Counter** - Shows total number of questions in footer
- **Responsive Design** - Large modal (max-w-4xl) with scrollable content
- **Preview Alert** - Informational banner explaining preview mode

#### Supported Question Types:
1. **Likert Scale** (5-point or 7-point)
   - Radio button selection
   - Labels: "Strongly Disagree" to "Strongly Agree"
   - Bilingual labels

2. **NPS** (0-10 scale)
   - Radio button selection
   - Labels: "Not at all likely" to "Extremely likely"
   - Bilingual labels

3. **Multiple Choice (Single)**
   - Radio button selection
   - Displays all options

4. **Multiple Choice (Multiple)**
   - Checkbox selection
   - Multiple selections allowed

5. **Text Response**
   - Textarea input
   - Respects maxLength config
   - 4-row textarea
   - Bilingual placeholders

6. **Number Input**
   - Number input field
   - Respects min/max config
   - Bilingual placeholders

7. **Rating (Stars)**
   - Interactive star rating
   - Configurable scale (3, 5, 7, or 10 stars)
   - Visual feedback with yellow filled stars
   - Shows rating count (e.g., "3 / 5")

#### UI/UX Details:
- Question numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- Required indicators (red asterisk)
- Card-based layout for each question
- Proper spacing and typography
- Bilingual support throughout
- Empty state handling

### 2. Updated QuestionnaireCreateForm Component
**File**: `/src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-create-form.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
1. **Added Import**:
   ```typescript
   import { QuestionnairePreviewModal } from './questionnaire-preview-modal';
   import { Eye } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

2. **Added State**:
   ```typescript
   const [isPreviewOpen, setIsPreviewOpen] = useState(false);
   ```

3. **Added Preview Button**:
   - Positioned next to "Cancel" button in footer
   - Eye icon for visual clarity
   - Disabled when no questions exist
   - Disabled during form submission
   - Outline variant for secondary action

4. **Integrated Modal**:
   ```typescript
   <QuestionnairePreviewModal
     open={isPreviewOpen}
     onClose={() => setIsPreviewOpen(false)}
     title={title}
     questions={questions}
   />
   ```

5. **Button Layout Update**:
   - Left side: Cancel + Preview buttons
   - Right side: Save as Draft + Save & Publish buttons
   - Proper spacing with flex gap-2

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Preview modal uses local state for form values
- Form values are isolated and don't affect parent component
- Modal state is controlled via `open` prop

### Type Safety
- Fully TypeScript typed
- Reuses `Question` interface from `question-builder.tsx`
- Proper type guards for question type rendering

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations
- Dialog closes with X button or ESC key
- Focus management via Radix UI Dialog
- Screen reader support with sr-only text

### Internationalization
- Language toggle between EN/FR
- `getQuestionText()` helper function for text extraction
- Fallback logic: displays available language if one is missing
- Bilingual labels for all question types

### Performance Considerations
- Preview values stored in local state (doesn't affect parent)
- No API calls in preview mode
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## Files Created

1. **questionnaire-preview-modal.tsx** (252 lines)
   - Complete modal component
   - Question rendering logic
   - Language toggle functionality
   - Interactive form elements

## Files Modified

1. **questionnaire-create-form.tsx**
   - Added imports (lines 14-15)
   - Added state (line 55)
   - Updated action buttons section (lines 513-578)
   - Added modal component (lines 573-578)

## Design Decisions

### 1. Interactive vs Static Preview
**Decision**: Made preview interactive
**Rationale**: Allows users to test the user experience, including tab order, input behavior, and visual feedback

### 2. Language Toggle Placement
**Decision**: Placed in header between title and questions
**Rationale**: Easy to find, doesn't interfere with question flow, clear visual separation

### 3. Button Placement
**Decision**: Preview button on left with Cancel
**Rationale**: Secondary action (preview doesn't save), keeps primary actions (Draft/Publish) on right

### 4. Disabled Submit Button
**Decision**: Show disabled submit button in preview
**Rationale**: Reinforces that this is preview mode, shows what real questionnaire will look like

### 5. Modal Size
**Decision**: max-w-4xl (1280px max width)
**Rationale**: Large enough to show questionnaire comfortably, small enough to feel like preview

### 6. Empty State
**Decision**: Show message when no questions added
**Rationale**: Prevents confusion, guides users to add questions first

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Preview button appears in form header
- [ ] Preview button is disabled when no questions exist

## Next Steps / Recommendations

### Potential Enhancements (Future):
1. **Add "Edit" Links**: Allow users to jump to specific question in builder from preview
2. **Preview Statistics**: Show estimated completion time based on question count
3. **Device Preview Modes**: Toggle between desktop/tablet/mobile views
4. **Save Preview Link**: Generate shareable preview link for stakeholder review
5. **Accessibility Checker**: Add warnings for missing alt text, contrast issues, etc.
6. **Test Mode**: Allow test responses that save to a test database
7. **Preview from Questionnaire Detail Page**: Add preview to edit/detail views

### Code Quality:
- Component is well-structured and maintainable
- TypeScript types are properly defined
- Follows existing code patterns in the project
- Reuses existing UI components from Shadcn
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies: None
All functionality uses existing dependencies:
