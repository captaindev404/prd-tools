---

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Database Models ✅

**Migration**: `20251013125241_add_hris_models`

Created two new models in Prisma schema:

#### HRISSync Model
Tracks all sync operations with comprehensive statistics:
- Sync status (pending, in_progress, completed, failed)
- Sync type (full, incremental, manual)
- Statistics: recordsProcessed, recordsCreated, recordsUpdated, recordsFailed, conflictsDetected
- Timing: startedAt, completedAt
- Error tracking: errorMessage, errorDetails (JSON)
- Metadata: triggeredBy (user ID), metadata (JSON config)

**File**: `/prisma/schema.prisma` lines 550-579

#### HRISConflict Model
Manages identity conflicts requiring manual resolution:
- Conflict types: duplicate_email, duplicate_employee_id, email_change, data_mismatch, village_not_found
- HRIS data: hrisEmployeeId, hrisEmail, hrisData (JSON)
- System data: existingUserId, systemData (JSON)
- Resolution tracking: status, resolution, resolvedBy, resolvedAt, resolutionNotes

**File**: `/prisma/schema.prisma` lines 581-609

---

### 2. HRIS Client Library ✅

**File**: `/src/lib/hris/hris-client.ts` (313 lines)

Comprehensive API client for HRIS system integration:

#### Features:

  - employee_id, email, first_name, last_name, display_name
  - department, village_id, role, status (active/inactive/departed)
  - Transfer tracking: start_date, end_date, transfer_date, previous_village_id

- **HRISClient Class**: Production-ready API client
  - `fetchAllEmployees()`: Paginated employee retrieval with status filtering
  - `fetchEmployee(employeeId)`: Single employee lookup
  - `fetchEmployeesSince(since)`: Incremental sync support
  - `testConnection()`: Health check endpoint
  - Authentication with Bearer token
  - 30-second timeout with abort controller
  - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Email change (same employee_id, different email)
   - Duplicate email (same email, different employee_id)
   - Duplicate employee_id
   - Data mismatch
   - Village not found

#### Conflict Resolution:
- **Auto-Resolution**: Safe conflicts resolved automatically
  - Email change (if new email not in use)
  - Village not found (create without village)

- **Manual Resolution**: Admin intervention required
  - `keep_system`: Keep existing system data
  - `use_hris`: Replace with HRIS data
  - `merge`: Selective merge of both
  - `create_new`: Create new user account

#### Statistics & Reporting:
- `getPendingConflicts()`: List conflicts by sync or all

## Technical Implementation Details

### Identity Reconciliation Algorithm

The reconciliation engine ensures global user IDs (usr_* format) are never changed while keeping employee data synchronized:

```typescript
1. Match by employee_id (primary key)
   ├─ Email matches → UPDATE user
   ├─ Email differs → CONFLICT (email_change)
   └─ Not found → Try email match

2. Match by email (fallback)
   ├─ Employee_id matches → UPDATE user
   ├─ Employee_id differs → CONFLICT (duplicate_email)
   └─ Not found → CREATE new user

3. Validate village exists
   └─ Village not found → CONFLICT (village_not_found)

4. Auto-resolve safe conflicts
   ├─ Email change (if new email free) → AUTO-RESOLVE
   └─ Village not found → CREATE without village

5. Manual resolution required
   ├─ Duplicate email with different employee_id
   ├─ Data mismatch
   └─ Complex scenarios
```

---

### Village Transfer Tracking

Automatic detection and recording of village transfers:

```typescript
// Existing user with village transfer
User: { currentVillageId: "vlg-001", villageHistory: [...] }
HRIS: { village_id: "vlg-002", transfer_date: "2024-01-01" }

Result:
1. Close current village assignment:
   { village_id: "vlg-001", from: "2023-01-15", to: "2024-01-01" }

2. Add new village assignment:
   { village_id: "vlg-002", from: "2024-01-01", to: null }

3. Update currentVillageId to "vlg-002"
```

---

### Sync Statistics

Real-time tracking of sync operations:
- **recordsProcessed**: Total employees from HRIS
- **recordsCreated**: New user accounts created
- **recordsUpdated**: Existing users updated
- **recordsFailed**: Errors during processing
- **conflictsDetected**: Conflicts requiring attention
- **conflictsAutoResolved**: Automatically resolved
- **duration**: Sync execution time (milliseconds)

---

## Audit Logging

All HRIS operations are logged:

### Audit Events:
- `hris.user_created`: New employee onboarding
- `hris.user_updated`: Profile sync updates
- `hris.sync_triggered`: Manual sync initiated
- `hris.sync_completed`: Sync finished successfully
- `hris.sync_failed`: Sync encountered errors
- `hris.conflict_resolved`: Admin resolved conflict
- `hris.webhook_received`: Webhook event received

### Audit Data:
- Actor (user or system)
- Action type
- Resource ID (user, sync, conflict)
- IP address and user agent
- Metadata (full context)
- Timestamp

**Integration**: Uses existing `audit-log.ts` infrastructure

---

## Testing
