**State Management** (lines 40-41):
```typescript
const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
const [questions, setQuestions] = useState<Question[]>([]);
```

**Import** (line 13):
```typescript
import { QuestionBuilder, Question } from './question-builder';
```

**Integration** (lines 363-376):
```typescript
<TabsContent value="questions" className="space-y-4">
  <Card>
    <CardHeader>
      <CardTitle>Build Your Questions</CardTitle>
      <CardDescription>
        Add and configure questions for your questionnaire.
      </CardDescription>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
      <QuestionBuilder questions={questions} onChange={setQuestions} />
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
</TabsContent>
```

### 3. Validation
**File**: `src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-create-form.tsx` (lines 78-94)

```typescript
// Questions validation
if (questions.length === 0) {
  return 'At least one question is required';
}

// Check all questions have text
for (let i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
  const q = questions[i];
  if (!q) continue;
  if (!q.text.trim()) {
    return `Question ${i + 1} must have text`;
  }
  // MCQ validation
  if ((q.type === 'mcq_single' || q.type === 'mcq_multiple') &&
      (!q.config?.options || q.config.options.length < 2)) {
    return `Question ${i + 1} (Multiple Choice) must have at least 2 options`;
  }
}
```

**Validation Rules**:
- ✅ At least 1 question required
- ✅ Question text required (non-empty)
- ✅ MCQ questions must have at least 2 options
- ✅ Clear error messages with question number

### 4. Form Submission
**File**: `src/components/questionnaires/questionnaire-create-form.tsx` (lines 138-145)

```typescript
// Transform questions to match API format
const transformedQuestions = questions.map((q, index) => ({
  id: q.id,
  type: q.type,
  text: q.text,
  required: q.required,
  order: index,
  config: q.config,
}));
```

**API Payload** (lines 147-161):
```typescript
const createData = {
  title: title.trim(),
  questions: transformedQuestions,
  targeting: { ... },
  anonymous,
  responseLimit: ...,
  startAt: ...,
  endAt: ...,
  maxResponses: ...,
};
```
