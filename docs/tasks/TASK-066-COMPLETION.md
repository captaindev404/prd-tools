**Task ID**: 066
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Agent**: A23

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive video recording and playback infrastructure for user testing sessions, including browser-based recording, chunked uploads, secure storage, annotations, and transcription support.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

**File**: `/prisma/schema.prisma`

Added three new enums and one model:

```prisma
enum RecordingStatus {
  initializing
  recording
  paused
  processing
  completed
  failed
  deleted
}

enum RecordingType {
  camera
  screen
  both
}

model SessionRecording {
  // 40+ fields covering metadata, storage, transcription, annotations, GDPR
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Recording metadata (type, status, duration, file info)
- S3-compatible storage URLs with signed URL support
- Chunked upload tracking
- Transcription support (Whisper API)
- Timestamp annotations and highlights
- GDPR-compliant expiry and soft delete
- Comprehensive indexing for performance

## Technical Architecture

### Recording Flow

```
1. Initialize Recording
   ├─> POST /api/recording/start
   ├─> Create SessionRecording record
   └─> Return recordingId

2. Browser Recording
   ├─> MediaRecorderWrapper starts capture
   ├─> Generate 10-second chunks
   └─> Emit onDataAvailable events

3. Upload Chunks
   ├─> POST /api/recording/upload (per chunk)
   ├─> StorageClient.uploadChunk()
   └─> Update chunkUrls array

4. Finalize Recording
   ├─> POST /api/recording/finalize
   ├─> Upload final merged file
   ├─> Generate signed URL
   ├─> Trigger transcription (optional)
   └─> Update status to completed

5. Playback
   ├─> GET /api/recording/playback/[id]
   ├─> Check permissions & expiry
   ├─> Refresh signed URL if needed
   └─> Return playback data
```

### Storage Strategy

**Chunked Uploads**:
- 10-second chunks during recording
- Improves reliability over network issues
- Enables progress tracking
- Final file uploaded at completion

**Signed URLs**:
- 1-hour expiry for security
- Auto-refresh on access
- Prevents direct storage access
- GDPR-compliant

**Retention**:
- Configurable per session (default 365 days)
- Soft delete with audit trail
- Automatic expiry support
- Physical deletion via cleanup job (to be implemented)

## Security & Privacy

### GDPR Compliance
1. **Consent Management**
   - Recording consent tracked per session
   - Required before recording starts
   - Stored in session record

2. **Data Retention**
   - Configurable retention period (default 365 days)
   - Automatic expiry dates
   - Soft delete for audit trail

3. **Access Control**
   - Facilitator/researcher/admin only

   - Audit logs for access and deletion

4. **Secure Storage**
   - Signed URLs with 1-hour expiry
   - No direct storage access
   - Encrypted at rest (provider-level)

### Best Practices
- Always inform participants before recording
- Store recordings in EU region if required
- Delete recordings after project completion
- Limit access to essential personnel only
- Review and purge expired recordings

- Progressive streaming via signed URLs
- Client-side annotation rendering
- Efficient timeline rendering

### Storage
- Separate bucket for recordings
