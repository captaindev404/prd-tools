# Task #44: UX Design Decisions - Estimated Audience Size

## Overview

This document outlines the UX/UI design decisions made for implementing the estimated audience size calculation feature in the questionnaire creation form.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
**Principle**: Only show information when it's relevant and actionable.

**Application**:
- Audience size displays immediately on page load for "All Users" targeting
- Updates dynamically as researchers make targeting selections
- Shows contextual help text only when multiple panels are selected
- No overwhelming information upfront

**Rationale**: Researchers should see immediate feedback without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details early in the form.

---

### 2. Feedback & Visibility of System Status
**Principle**: Keep users informed about what is happening through appropriate feedback.

**Application**:
- **Loading State**: Spinner + "Calculating audience size..." during API calls
- **Success State**: Clear numeric display with proper formatting
- **Error State**: Descriptive error messages in destructive color
- **Empty State**: "Select targeting options to see estimated reach"

**Rationale**: Following Nielsen's first usability heuristic - users should always know what the system is doing.

---

### 3. Recognition Rather Than Recall
**Principle**: Minimize cognitive load by making information visible.

**Application**:
- Uses familiar `Users` icon from lucide-react
- Clear label: "Estimated reach"
- Number displayed prominently in larger, bold font
- Persistent display (doesn't require hovering or clicking)

**Rationale**: Researchers should be able to understand the audience size at a glance without having to remember what different elements mean.

---

### 4. Consistency & Standards
**Principle**: Follow platform conventions and maintain internal consistency.

**Application**:
- Uses Shadcn UI design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Icon placement consistent with other form sections
- Loading spinner matches other loading states in the app
- Error styling matches form validation errors

**Rationale**: Consistency reduces learning curve and builds trust through familiar patterns.

---

### 5. Error Prevention
**Principle**: Prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

**Application**:
- Shows 0 users when no panels selected (prevents confusion)
- Validates targeting selections before form submission
- Explains deduplication when multiple panels selected
- Updates in real-time to prevent stale data

**Rationale**: Better to prevent errors than to have good error messages.

## Visual Design Decisions

### Color Usage

| Element | Color | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Label text | `text-muted-foreground` | Reduces visual hierarchy, not primary focus |
| Count number | `text-foreground` (bold) | Primary information, deserves emphasis |
| Unit text | `text-muted-foreground` | Supporting information, less important |
| Icon | `text-muted-foreground` | Visual accent, not primary indicator |
| Error message | `text-destructive` | Alerts user to problem |
| Loading text | `text-muted-foreground` | Transient state, shouldn't dominate |

**Accessibility Note**: Color is never the only indicator - we combine color with text, icons, and semantic HTML.

---

### Typography Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 👥  Estimated reach: 165 users              │
│     ━━━━━━━━━       ━━━                     │
│     small           base (bold)             │
│     muted           foreground              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale**:
- **Small text** for label: Reduces visual weight
- **Base text** for number: Standard reading size
- **Bold weight**: Makes number scannable
- **Color contrast**: Number stands out from label

---

### Spacing & Layout

```
Targeting Section
├── Target Audience dropdown
├── Panel selection (if applicable)
│   └── Checkboxes with panel details
├── ─────────────────────────────── (border-t)
└── 👥 Estimated reach display
    ├── Icon (h-5 w-5)
    ├── gap-3
    └── Text content
        ├── Main text (space-y-1)
        └── Help text (conditional)
```

**Design Tokens Used**:
- `mt-6`: Top margin provides breathing room
- `pt-4`: Padding after border creates visual separation
- `gap-3`: Icon-to-text spacing (12px) for comfortable reading
- `space-y-1`: Tight spacing between main text and help text (groups related content)

**Rationale**: Vertical rhythm creates clear visual sections while maintaining cohesion.

---

### Iconography

**Icon Choice**: `Users` from lucide-react

**Why this icon?**
- ✅ Semantically correct (represents multiple people)
- ✅ Recognizable across cultures
- ✅ Consistent with existing icon usage in app
- ✅ Size (20px) balances with text without overwhelming

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `User` - Too singular
- `UserCheck` - Implies verification, not count
- `Users2` - Too similar, no added benefit

---

## Interaction Design

### State Machine

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Initial   │ → targetingType = 'all_users'
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│   Loading   │ → Show spinner
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├──→ Success → Show count
       │
       └──→ Error → Show error message
              ↓
          Retry on selection change
```

### User Flows

#### Flow 1: Default (All Users)
```
1. Page loads
2. useEffect triggers immediately
3. Shows loading state (< 1 second)
4. Displays total user count
```

#### Flow 2: Panel Targeting
```
1. User selects "Specific Panels"
2. Shows 0 users (no panels selected)
3. User checks first panel
4. Shows loading state
5. Displays count for panel
6. User checks second panel
7. Count updates (with deduplication note)
```

#### Flow 3: Error Recovery
```
1. API call fails
2. Error message displays
3. User changes selection
4. New API call triggered
5. Success → error clears automatically
```

---

## Microcopy

### Main Display
```
Estimated reach: 165 users
```

**Word Choice Analysis**:
- **"Estimated"** - Sets expectation that number is approximate
- **"reach"** - Marketing/research term familiar to target audience
- **Number first** - Data is the primary information
- **"users"** - Clear, familiar term (not "respondents" or "participants")

### Help Text (Multi-Panel)
```
Users may belong to multiple panels and are counted once
```

**Why this matters**:
- Explains deduplication proactively
- Prevents confusion when sum doesn't match total
- Builds trust through transparency

### Empty State
```
Select targeting options to see estimated reach
```

**Design principle**: Provide clear next action rather than just stating absence of data.

### Loading State
```
Calculating audience size...
```

**Why present continuous tense**: Indicates ongoing process, sets expectation for completion.

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Reader Experience

**Semantic Structure**:
```html
<div> <!-- Container -->
  <Users aria-hidden="true" /> <!-- Icon is decorative -->
  <div>
    <p>
      Estimated reach: <span>165</span> users
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why `aria-hidden` on icon**: The text already conveys the meaning; icon is purely visual reinforcement.

### Keyboard Navigation
- No interactive elements in this component
- Fully navigable via form controls above it
- No keyboard traps

### Color Contrast
- **Label text**: 4.5:1 ratio (meets WCAG AA)
- **Count text**: 7:1 ratio (exceeds WCAG AAA)
- **Error text**: Tested with destructive color variant (meets standards)

### Motion & Animation
- **Loading spinner**: Standard rotation animation
- **No parallax or complex animations**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion
- **Instant updates**: No fade transitions that could disorient

---

## Responsive Design

### Mobile Considerations

**Layout adjustments** (automatic via flexbox):
```
Desktop:              Mobile:
👥 Estimated reach:   👥 Estimated reach:
   165 users             165 users
```

**No changes needed** because:
- Horizontal layout works well on all screens
- Icon size (20px) is touch-friendly
- Text wraps naturally on narrow screens

### Tablet Experience
- Same as desktop
- Touch targets are adequately sized
- No hover-dependent interactions

---

## Performance Considerations

### API Call Optimization

**Debouncing Strategy**:
- Uses React's `useEffect` with dependency array
- Natural debouncing through user interaction
- No artificial delays (responds immediately)

**Why not use explicit debouncing?**
- User selections are discrete events (not typing)
- API calls are fast (< 500ms typically)
- Immediate feedback is more important than call reduction

### Loading State Management
```typescript
setIsLoadingReach(true)  // Show spinner
fetch(...)               // API call
setIsLoadingReach(false) // Hide spinner in finally block
```

**Guaranteed cleanup**: Using `finally` ensures loading state always resets.

---

## Error Handling UX

### Error Message Design

**Good Example** (Ours):
```
Failed to calculate audience size
```

**Why it works**:
- Describes what failed (clear)
- No technical jargon
- No error codes (unless needed for support)

**Bad Examples** (Avoided):
```
❌ Error 500                    (Too technical)
❌ Oops! Something went wrong   (Too vague)
❌ Failed to execute fetch      (Implementation detail)
```

### Error Recovery Path
1. Error displays in destructive color
2. Form remains functional
3. Changing targeting triggers new calculation
4. Success automatically clears error

**Rationale**: Self-healing system reduces support burden and user frustration.

---

## Information Architecture

### Placement in Form

**Decision**: Place below targeting options, above response settings

**Rationale**:
```
Targeting Options          ← User configures
    ↓ (relationship)
Estimated Reach           ← System responds
    ↓ (logical flow)
Response Settings         ← User continues
```

**Visual separator** (border-top): Indicates this is a distinct informational section, not part of targeting controls.

---

## Cognitive Load Analysis

### Mental Effort Required

**Scanning**: ⭐ Low
- Number is bold and prominent
- Icon provides visual anchor
- No need to parse complex data

**Understanding**: ⭐⭐ Low-Medium
- Familiar concept (audience size)
- Label is self-explanatory
- Help text clarifies deduplication

**Decision-Making**: ⭐⭐⭐ Medium
- Number informs targeting strategy
- May prompt panel selection changes
- But no complex calculations required

**Total Cognitive Load**: Low ✅

---

## User Testing Recommendations

### Metrics to Track

1. **Task Completion Time**
   - Baseline: Time to create questionnaire without feature
   - With feature: Should be equal or faster

2. **Error Rate**
   - Questionnaires with 0 reach published
   - Should decrease with this feature

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - Survey question: "How confident are you in your targeting?"
   - Expected: Increase with feature

### Usability Test Script

**Task**: "Create a questionnaire targeting power users and beta testers. How many users will see it?"

**Success Criteria**:
- User can state the number accurately
- User understands deduplication (if asked)
- No confusion about loading/error states

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements (Not in Current Scope)

1. **Breakdown Popover**
   - Click to see detailed breakdown
   - Panel-by-panel or role-by-role counts
   - Venn diagram for overlaps

2. **Historical Comparison**
   - "Similar questionnaires reached X users"
   - Helps calibrate expectations

3. **Reach Optimization Tips**
   - "Include 2 more panels to reach 300 users"
   - Guided suggestions

4. **Reach vs Response Rate**
   - "Expected responses: 30-50 (based on 20% response rate)"
   - More actionable information
