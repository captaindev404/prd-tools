/**
 * Manual Test Instructions:
 *
 * 1. Set environment variables:
 *    export HRIS_SYNC_ENABLED=true
 *    export NODE_ENV=development
 *
 * 2. Run a dry-run sync:
 *    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/hris/sync \
 *      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 *      -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
 *      -d '{"syncType": "manual", "dryRun": true}'
 *
 * 3. Check sync status:
 *    curl http://localhost:3000/api/hris/status?view=summary \
 *      -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie"
 *
 * 4. View conflicts:
 *    curl http://localhost:3000/api/hris/conflicts \
 *      -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie"
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - Mock client returns 4 employees (see hris-client.ts MockHRISClient)
 * - Sync should process all 4 employees
 * - One employee (Bob Transfer) has a village transfer
 * - One employee (Alice Departed) has departed status
 * - No conflicts should occur on first sync
 * - Subsequent syncs should update existing records
