# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**InfiniteStories** is a SwiftUI iOS/macOS app that generates personalized audio bedtime stories for children. Parents create hero characters with customizable traits, then generate AI-powered stories for different daily events or custom scenarios. Each story is converted to high-quality audio for playback during bedtime, with support for multiple languages and themes.

## Architecture

### Core Data Models (SwiftData)
- **Hero**: Character with name, personality traits, appearance, special abilities, and AI-generated avatar
  - Avatar images stored in Documents/Avatars directory with URL reference in model

  - Computed properties: avatarURL, hasAvatar, traitsDescription, fullDescription
- **Story**: Enhanced story content with comprehensive illustration support
  - Auto-regenerates audio when content changes via didSet observers
  - Supports both built-in and custom events with dual relationship pattern
  - Advanced illustration management with timeline synchronization
  - Progress tracking, error handling, and retry mechanisms for illustrations
  - Computed properties: eventTitle, eventPromptSeed, hasIllustrations, illustrationProgress

- **HeroVisualProfile**: NEW - Character consistency system
  - Detailed visual characteristics (hair, eyes, skin, clothing)
  - Canonical and simplified prompts for consistent generation
  - Art style and color palette definitions
  - Methods: generateSceneCharacterDescription, generateStyleConsistencyPrompt
- **CustomStoryEvent**: Enhanced user-defined scenarios
  - Categories, age ranges, and tone settings with comprehensive enums

- Add illustration preloading for better performance

## Development Commands

### Building and Testing
```bash
# Build (requires Xcode installation)
xcodebuild -project InfiniteStories.xcodeproj -scheme InfiniteStories build

- **Store** API keys in Keychain, never hardcode
- **Handle** errors explicitly with user messages
- **Disable** idle timer during audio playback
- **Enable** background modes for audio/processing
- **Follow** SwiftUI patterns and best practices
- **Maintain** 44pt minimum touch targets
- **Support** VoiceOver and Dynamic Type

## Cost and Usage Guidelines

- Monitor API usage to control costs (increased with illustration generation)
- Implement caching where appropriate (especially for illustrations)
- Consider batch operations for efficiency
- Track user usage patterns for optimization
- Plan for ~$0.75-1.00 per active user monthly (increased due to illustrations)
- Illustration generation adds ~$0.20-0.30 per story with visual content
- Content filtering reduces API rejections and associated costs

## Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.
- AppStore validation preparation
- Always fix the build
